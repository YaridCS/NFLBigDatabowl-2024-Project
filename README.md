NFL Big Databowl 2024 Project


The UConn Team's project for the Big Data Bowl 2024 innovatively analyzes NFL defensive performance by focusing on how defenses limit ballcarrier options. Utilizing given player tracking data by the NFL in a particular season, this project aims to quantify defensive positioning and effectiveness beyond traditional metrics. In our  approach, we divided the space around the ballcarrier into sectors, assessing the "danger" posed by defenders and the influence of blockers. By adjusting these sectors to account for biases and visualizing data through animations, we provided a nuanced, dynamic view of defensive play, providing valuable insights for improving football strategies and player evaluations.
